# About ezWake

ezWake is an innovative and simple app for the busy person who canâ€™t afford to accidentally fall back asleep. While normal alarm clocks have alluring snooze buttons, ezWake will ensure that you have woken up before allowing you to stop the alarm.

The app will let you create new alarms just as you would with any other alarm clock. However, once an alarm is triggered instead of presenting the user with a toggle to turn the alarm off, the user will be given math questions to solve.

Research has shown that once the brain is active, it is much harder to fall back asleep. By doing a few math questions in the mornings, your brain will be activated and it will be easier for you to stay awake. It is also a great way to get better and faster at math, as you will be getting a lot more practice with the ezWake Alarm app!

**How does the app work?**
- You can set up to three alarms
- Once an alarm is set off, the app will wake up your screen and display some randomly -
generated math questions.
- You must solve the math questions to stop the alarm from ringing.
- Once all questions are solved, the alarm will stop.
- By using the alarm for around 20 seconds, your brain will be activated and it will be much easier to wake up.

**How do I use this app?**
- First, you can create new alarms by pressing the + button.
- You can toggle alarms on and off using the switches on the home page.
- You can clear existing alarms to create new ones by holding on an alarm.
